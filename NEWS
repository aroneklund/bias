Changes in version 0.0.5 (2012-03-13)

- Added messages for time-consuming parts of "getBiasMetrics(2)"
- New function ".mas5calls2" which doesn't choke on newer arrays that don't have MM probes, and is also a bit faster in general
- Add error checking to present.calls in "getBiasMetrics2" so it doesn't crash on newer platforms
- Update CITATION file, add NAMESPACE file
- Rename ChangeLog file to NEWS and standardize the format.
- Replace examples using data from the "SpikeIn95" package with data from the (smaller) "affydata" package
- No longer Suggests "SpikeIn95"


Changes in version 0.0.4 (2008-09-09)

- Removed function "plotDendroCol", which never really belonged in this package. (see "dendromat" in the "squash" package for a better implementation)
- Added function "getBiasMetrics2", which is like "getBiasMetrics" but adds a few more metrics.
- Added function "borders".


Changes in version 0.0.3 (2008-02-11)

- Updated "references" section to reflect publication.
- Changed "License:" field in DESCRIPTION to match current R recommendations.
- Fixed "unmatched right brace in ..." warnings on installation.
- Removed "require(affy)" from a few functions.
- Improved and expanded man pages.
- Modified to "batchCorrection" to deal with the case in which a batch level has only one member.
